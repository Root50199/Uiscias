UPDATED FOR 10/16/2025
All client modifications are against Nexon's ToS, use at your own risk. Intended solely for Mabinogi (North America).

A small collection of .it mods for Mabinogi. The mods I make or release here are intended to increase accessibility and reduce frustration with the client. I will not be adding anything that fundamentally changes any game function, such as turning fireball into an ICBM.
This is a side project for me and I will work on adding to and maintaining it when time allows, but I make no guarantees or commitments in that regard. 
I will also avoid adding anything that is already in https://github.com/shaggyze/uotiara unless I have meaningfully changed it myself.

Releases will contain the packed .it files ready for use. Just place them in Mabinogi\appdata\package to install. Delete to uninstall.
If you wish to create your own .it files the raw files will be in the source. 

The ones in "Evergreen" SHOULD never need to be updated. These are files nexon rarely/never updates.
All others will likely need to be updated after almost every patch. I will try to have a basic explanation of how the file was changed so you may update it yourself if you have the tools and know-how. 
I will update them here myself when I have time, but this is not a high priority for me right now.

What each file does is listed in releases. If a mod pack contains multiple files the base folders for Evergreen and MaintenanceRequired contain readmes for the mod packs within them, otherwise the readmes are in the same folder as the single file mods.
At some point I'll be reformatting how the source is laid out since right now it is more of the old data file style, rather than separate .it files.

Feel free to open requests, if I feel it is something I can do and doesn’t go to0 far in changing how the game works I’ll look into it.
Current  WIP is reducing and differentiating particle effects in bri. Too much red on red on red.

I found it in an unusable state, but reversed and then significantly modified it myself.

Glenn simplified is from https://erinn.world/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=21880

phantsightsimp original concept was from uotiara, the one here is my take on it.

Statuses contains most of the same modifications as uotiara, but some have been removed or added by me.

RevivedIsimp was originally sent to me anonymously. I have changed very little of it beyond tidying it up. 

The rest are from scratch by me.

Useful tools for making or maintaining mods:
I use BeyondCompare 5 to check if mods need to be updated post patch. I can usually also perform the updates directly with it as well.

Voidtools Everything search for windows is very useful for searching the entire data folder when trying to engineer a mod from scratch.

mabi-pack2 from https://github.com/shaggyze/uotiara for actually unpacking/repacking the .it files.
