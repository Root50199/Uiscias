Race.xml has several ways to be modded so will be seperated out here, when packing for yourself rename the file to just Race.xml

    For the gate three Halos start by searching for <Race ID="7604" ClassName="Shard_Of_Comfort_1"
      Here there will be 5 entries that are all the same other than the number labels. These are the drones that follow the boss around, the halos you need to burst at 80% and 40% and the halos at 60%. The Drones around the boss at the start will always be 1, 2 and 3. 
      The ones on the ground will be 1-5 (depending on phase) randomly scattered.
      At 60% they are always 1, 2, and 3.
      The game can only display up to 3 boss HP bars at once and 1 will be the main boss. At most you should have 2 of the halos changed to display one and if you want to be able to see all 3 at 60 you will need 2 people running different mods.
      To add a life bar to an entity add "/lifebar_cnd/" to the list of IDs in "StringID="
      I suggest also changing "LocalName" from a file line reference to plain text in quotes. Make any you change have unique names so you can tell them apart in game. I just label mine "Shard of Solace 1", "Shard of Solace 2" etc.
      Example fully modded halo 1:
      <Race ID="7604" ClassName="Shard_Of_Comfort_1" StringID="/boss/shard_of_comfort/shard_of_comfort_1/detect/no_pet_finish/not_spark/not_swallow/no_rankup_effect/unable_bubble/unable_sharpmind/unable_tame/not_freeze/no_stone/no_one_die/not_raincasting/not_sleep/unable_losesight2/immune_dot/unable_lure/not_groggy/Giantfieldboss/elemental_item_immune/use_dead_motion/no_movelock_by_hit/no_delay/no_hitmotion/not_down/no_blowaway/no_counterattack/brionac_limit/fragarach_limit/lifebar_cnd/not_interrupt_by_skill/boundary_adj/ice_mine_immune/use_c4/not_deathescape/immune_hold/no_find_material/piercing9/player_priority_target/no_name/no_targetmark/" Feature="" CollectCategory="" TrainingCategory="" EnglishName="Shard of Comfort" LocalName="Shard of Solace 1" Gender="2" Appearance="0" IsNPC="true" IsGoodNPC="false" Equipment="false" EquipmentVisible="false" InventorySizeX="6" InventorySizeY="10" Gaze="false" MeleeAttackRange="170" DefaultAttackSpeed="2" DefaultDownHitCount="2" Framework="mon_lm_obj_framework" DefaultMesh="mon_lm_obj1" RaceDesc="lm/object" BlowAwayEnable="true" ShovedEnable="true" CombatSkill="23002" SplashRadius="180" SplashAngle="60" SplashDamage="0" AttackMin="0" AttackMax="0" WAttackMin="0" WAttackMax="0" Critical="0" Rate="0" CriticalResist="0" PoisonDamage="0" PoisonImmune="100" PoisonDamageRatio1="0" PoisonDamageRatio2="0" LifeRecoveryRate="1" RunSpeedFactor="1" WeakPoints="" ExtraData="&lt;xml enablealphaout='false' br_deprot_rate=&quot;20&quot; fra_deprot_rate=&quot;20&quot; groupMovement=&quot;0,450,-100,2.0&quot; /&gt;" FirstCreateStript="setmonsterskill(23003, 5);" />
    
    Another useful thing that can be done in this file is adding "/targetable_healing/" to <Race ID="600013" ClassName="HGD_Heal_Wisp_NPC"
        This is the orb in the hellgate event. It needs to be healed, but for some reason they didn't make it targetable by healing. You can also add "/lifebar_cnd/" to it, but be aware it is kinda janky. Still good for knowing when one spawns though. 
    
    You can also add "/lifebar_cnd/" to any mob or replace the lifebar they do have with it to give them the new type that displays statuses, a notable use for this is theta. 
        <Race ID="193220" ClassName="RPR_mutant_enemy"
    
    If you are replacing a lifebar make sure you remove the old one. For all changes ensure you have a single "/" between all entries and no spaces. 


AchievementTable.xml is just changing Hidden="True" to Hidden="False" and removing Prerequirement="*" entirely.
